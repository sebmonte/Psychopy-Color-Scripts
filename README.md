# Psychopy-Color-Scripts
A set of behavioral color experiments that use the psychopy library

These are a collection of experiments on color that I coded while working in the Laboratory of Brain and Cognition under Chris Baker. They were all in service of an experiment on color space in MEG but we ended up coding more paradigms than we used. The leftover experiments are still functional and could be used in other experiments.

Decriptions of contents:

Likert Task: This experiment presents a pair of colored circles to the user and then has them rate their similarity from 1-7.
Color Wheel task: This experiment presents a central color to the user and then displays an adjustable color wheel where participants can slide their selection along the wheel to the color that best matches the central color.
Triad Task: This experiment shows three colored spirals to the user.
